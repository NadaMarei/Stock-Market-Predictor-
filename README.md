## About The Project  

This project aims to Predicting stock prices by integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with Explainable AI (XAI) methods to enhance both predictive accuracy and the interpretability of the model.

**Stock-Predictor** is a deep Learning based web application for predicting stock market prices then giving a recommendation that might be buy, sell or hold and explaining that recommendation.
